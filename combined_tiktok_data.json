Hallucinations: These are sensory experiences that appear real but are created by the mind. The most common type is auditory hallucinations, where individuals hear voices that others do not. 2. Delusions: These are false beliefs strongly held despite contrary evidence. Common delusions in schizophrenia include paranoid delusions, such as believing one is being persecuted, or grandiose delusions, such as believing one has extraordinary abilities or fame. 3. Thought Disorder: This involves disorganised thinking, making it difficult to organize thoughts or connect them logically. It can result in incoherent speech, jumping from one topic to another, and difficulty in communicating effectively. 4. Self-Neglect: Individuals with schizophrenia may neglect personal hygiene and self-care. This can manifest as poor grooming, wearing dirty clothes, or neglecting to eat properly, often due to a lack of awareness or motivation. 5. Thought Alienation: This symptom involves a feeling that one’s thoughts are not one's own or are being inserted, withdrawn, or broadcasted. It creates a sense of external control over one's thoughts, leading to significant distress and confusion. #schizophrenia #psychosis #mentalhealth #psychiatry #psychiatrist ",

Faço isso para mostrar às pessoas que os episódios de esquizofrenia muitas vezes não são violentos. Estou seriamente no meu sofá a falar sozinha.Não magoar ninguém e não ser perigosa. Posso fazer caras de raiva... mas eu ainda só estou sentada no meu sofá. A esquizofrenia é uma doença mental crônica caracterizada por uma percepção distorcida da realidade, pensamento desorganizado e comportamento social anormal. O estresse pode afetar significativamente indivíduos com esquizofrenia, exacerbando seus sintomas e tornando mais desafiador gerir sua condição. Situações estressantes, como grandes mudanças na vida, conflitos ou eventos traumáticos, podem desencadear episódios psicóticos ou piorar os sintomas existentes. Além disso, o estresse constante de viver com uma doença mental crônica pode levar ao aumento da ansiedade, depressão e dificuldade em lidar com a vida diária. Por isso, é crucial que indivíduos com esquizofrenia desenvolvam estratégias eficazes de gestão do estresse e busquem apoio dos profissionais de saúde para minimizar o impacto do estresse no seu bem-estar geral. - Michelle Hammer",

Clearly I know what lighting can do for dialation given I literally WORK in MEDICAL. Turning the comments off because people want to try and prove me wrong on a disorder I have and experiences I have and tell me otherwise. I will always advocate for mental health and which disorders I have but can’t do that when people troll in the comments or just simply tell me I’m faking this very PAINFUL disorder that came from trauma as a child 🙄 don’t know why I’d fake having a life ruining disorder but ok? If you aren’t a doctor, as i’ve seen MANY, don’t tell me about myself or if it’s “just lighting” when it’s not or that i’m taking drugs when i’ve never taken anything a day in my life (yes i’m lame and “fun” at parties. Never found that stuff interesting, sue me). Haven’t had mania in a while but looking back on photos while I was is crazy! Surprised no one ever pulled me aside given you could see into my soul 😳 #maniceyes #mania #psychosiseyes #dialatedpupils #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #bpd #borderlinepersonalitydisorder #fyp ",

        "text": "Schizophrenia is a complex, chronic mental disorder that significantly affects perception of reality, emotions, and behaviors. The symptoms can be categorised into positive, negative, and cognitive groups. Positive symptoms include hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that aren’t there, and delusions, which are strongly held false beliefs. Negative symptoms are characterised by a decrease in the ability to function normally, such as diminished emotional expression, lack of motivation, and social withdrawal. Cognitive symptoms involve impairments in memory, attention, and executive functions, making it difficult for individuals to organise their thoughts and make decisions. The exact cause of schizophrenia remains unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic predispositions, brain chemistry imbalances, and environmental factors. Schizophrenia often emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood and often requires lifelong management.  Treatment typically involves antipsychotic medications to control symptoms and various forms of psychotherapy to support emotional and social functioning.  #schizophrenia #psychosis #mentalhealth #psychiatry #psychiatrist ",
